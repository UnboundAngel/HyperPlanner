# Assets

Drop app icons, illustrations, or marketing shots in this folder. Everything inside `public/assets` is served statically, so reference items via `/assets/<file>` in HTML or CSS.

## Subfolders
- `textures/`, `rings/`, `tabs/` – reserved art for a future binder-style calendar (currently unused).
- `gallery/` – stash photos, seasonal hero art, or marketing graphics here. Access via `/assets/gallery/<name>`.
